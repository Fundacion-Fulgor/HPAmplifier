# UNIC-CASS Postulations by Fundación Fulgor

This repository contains 5 versions of the HPA design. The first 3 are outdated versions, while the one called "OTA_Telescopic" includes the latest progress. In addition, the "OTA_Telescopic_TEST" folder contains tests of alternative solutions to issues with the tools/software.

Inside the "OTA_Telescopic" folder there are three directories:

  "Schematics_and_Symbols": contains all schematics, symbols, and IOCells for the designs;

  "Layout_and_Related_files": contains the layouts of the designs along with other related files;

  "Testbenchs": contains all tests performed on the design, with and without IOCells, as well as the "simulations" folder.

      OTA_Telescopic_TOP_TB_CMFB.sch: CMFB stability testbench.

      OTA_Telescopic_TOP_TB_CL.sch: closed-loop testbench.

      OTA_Telescopic_TOP_TB_OL.sch: open-loop testbench.

      OTA_Telescopic_TOP_TB_StartUp.sch: startup testbench.

      Testbenches that include "io" correspond to the same analyses performed while accounting for the effects of the IOCells.
